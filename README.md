Since I arrived in Canada about 6 months ago, I’ve been trying to learn French through different techniques. I’ve tried some of the most popular apps such as Duolingo, completed certain French grammar exercises, and watched a bunch of french movies as well. Although I’ve caught some bits of grammar and vocabulary along the way, I feel that these techniques are not efficient. After a bit of research, I realized that conventional methods to learn languages are inefficient as they are devoid of a real context. Immersion can significantly accelerate the learning process and I was curious to build an app that could make learning languages fun and highly efficient for me and all the other language learners.

This project is an app built for Android smart glasses with a camera and a microphone. The app features real-time intelligence to help you learn languages in an immersive context. When users wearing smart glasses look at any object around them, using the HUD(heads up display) screen they see what’s that object called in the target language. It currently supports 4 languages (French, Italian, German, Japanese) and displays the translation of the object’s name with the playback of the pronunciation.

The app uses multiple libraries for Object Recognition, Translation, and Text-to-Speech to combine real-time intelligence for language learning.
